xboomx is wrapper around the dmenu. It is also a launcher. All the things it done is just sorting commands to launch according to their launch frequency.
In other words - if you launch emacs and lxterminal all the time - they will appear in the list of commands first.

ljfrenzy is a bot for livejournal. The main aim is to make as many mutual friends as possible.
You specify the communities to gather victims from. And then bot adds this people to your friends.
If they don't friend you mutualy during next X days - they got deleted from your friends.
So as result you got something about ~700 mutual friends in month.
And the coolest thing is that you can "filter" your auditory to get the target audience using communities.
For example if you want all people from kiev you need just to add the kiev community to a list.

The project is abandoned now due to my livejournal inactivity. Last tested at the beginning of 2013.
