# About #
I am software developer with passion for distributed systems and functional programming.
You can check my personal [projects](projects.html).  
Also I write some [blog articles](articles.html) about the things I do.  
At the moment I live in Haarlem, Netherlands (that's next to Amsterdam). 
Together with my wife we are proud owners of [Chara - dutch shepherd dog](https://www.instagram.com/shepherd_chara/).
